[general]
bindaddr=0.0.0.0	; Address to bind to
bindport=2000		; Port to bind to, default tcp/2000
dateformat=M-D-Y	; M,D,Y in any order (6 chars max)
			; "A" may also be used, but it must be at the end.
			; Use M for month, D for day, Y for year, A for 12-hour time.
keepalive=120

;authtimeout = 30       ; authtimeout specifies the maximum number of seconds a
			; client has to authenticate.  If the client does not
			; authenticate beofre this timeout expires, the client
                        ; will be disconnected.  (default: 30 seconds)

;authlimit = 50         ; authlimit specifies the maximum number of
			; unauthenticated sessions that will be allowed to
                        ; connect at any given time. (default: 50)

;vmexten=8500		; Systemwide voicemailmain pilot number
			; It must be in the same context as the calling
			; device/line

; If regcontext is specified, Asterisk will dynamically create and destroy a
; NoOp priority 1 extension for a given line which registers or unregisters with
; us and have a "regexten=" configuration item.
; Multiple contexts may be specified by separating them with '&'. The
; actual extension is the 'regexten' parameter of the registering line or its
; name if 'regexten' is not provided.  If more than one context is provided,
; the context must be specified within regexten by appending the desired
; context after '@'.  More than one regexten may be supplied if they are
; separated by '&'.  Patterns may be used in regexten.

; The imeddialkey option allows for a key to be used to immediately dial the already
; entered number. This is useful where the dialplan includes variable length pattern
; matching. Valid options are '#' and '*'. On devices with soft buttons, a button will
; be available to immediately dial when a pattern than can be dialed has been entered.
; Default is unset, that is no immediated dial key (softbutton still exists).

;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------
;jbenable = yes              ; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of a
                             ; skinny channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
                             ; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
                             ; side can not accept jitter. The skinny channel can accept
                             ; jitter, thus a jitterbuffer on the receive skinny side will be
                             ; used only if it is forced and enabled.

;jbforce = no                ; Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive side of a skinny
                             ; channel. Defaults to "no".

;jbmaxsize = 200             ; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

;jbresyncthreshold = 1000    ; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
                             ; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
                             ; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
                             ; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

;jbimpl = fixed              ; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a
                             ; skinny channel. Two implementations are currently available
                             ; - "fixed" (with size always equals to jbmaxsize)
                             ; - "adaptive" (with variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2).
                             ; Defaults to fixed.

;jblog = no                  ; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".
